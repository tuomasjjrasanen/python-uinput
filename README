 Python-uinput
===============

Python-uinput is Python interface to Linux uinput kernel module which
allows attaching userspace device drivers into kernel. In practice,
Python-uinput makes it dead simple to create virtual joysticks,
keyboards and mice for generating arbitrary input events
programmatically.

Usage examples
==============

Generate keyboard clicks:

  import uinput
  
  device = uinput.Device([uinput.KEY_E, uinput.KEY_H, uinput.KEY_L, uinput.KEY_O])
  
  device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_H)
  device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_E)
  device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_L)
  device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_L)
  device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_O)

Move mouse cursor:

  import uinput
  
  device = uinput.Device([uinput.REL_X, uinput.REL_Y])
  
  for i in range(20):
      device.emit(uinput.REL_X, 5)
      device.emit(uinput.REL_Y, 5)

Generate keyboard combinations:

  import uinput
  
  device = uinput.Device([uinput.KEY_LEFTALT, uinput.KEY_TAB])
  
  device.emit_combo([uinput.KEY_LEFTALT, uinput.KEY_TAB])

See examples/ for other kind of example devices (keyboard, joystick).

How to install
==============

Just run the following commands:

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install
