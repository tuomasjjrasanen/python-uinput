How to use
==========

Create an input device with key-capabilities and use it to type a greeting:

    import uinput

    # Define the set of events our device is capable of emitting.
    events = (uinput.KEY_E, uinput.KEY_H, uinput.KEY_L, uinput.KEY_O)

    device = uinput.Device(events)

    device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_H)
    device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_E)
    device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_L)
    device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_L)
    device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_O)

See examples/ for other kind of example devices (joystick, mouse).

How to install
==============

If your are using Ubuntu or Debian, the easiest way to install
python-uinput is to install it as a pre-built binary package. Please
refer to the homepage for the instructions.

Otherwise, you are probably planning to build the source
package. Python-uinput uses libudev and therefore requires libudev
development files, more specifically libudev.h, to get compiled. On
Debian and its derivatives, the header file is packaged in
libudev-dev.

After satisfying dependencies described above, the basic installation
is easy. Just run the following command:

  python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local
