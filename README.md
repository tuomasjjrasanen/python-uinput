# Python-uinput


Python-uinput is Python interface to Linux uinput kernel module which
allows attaching userspace device drivers into kernel. In practice,
Python-uinput makes it dead simple to create virtual joysticks,
keyboards and mice for generating arbitrary input events
programmatically.

# Usage examples

## Generate keyboard clicks:


    import uinput
    
    with uinput.Device([uinput.KEY_E, uinput.KEY_H,
                  uinput.KEY_L, uinput.KEY_O]) as device:
        device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_H)
        device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_E)
        device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_L)
        device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_L)
        device.emit_click(uinput.KEY_O)

## Move mouse cursor:

    import uinput
    
    with uinput.Device([uinput.REL_X, uinput.REL_Y,
                    uinput.BTN_LEFT, uinput.BTN_RIGHT]) as device:
        for i in range(20):
            device.emit(uinput.REL_X, 5)
            device.emit(uinput.REL_Y, 5)

## Generate keyboard combinations:

    import uinput
    
    with uinput.Device([uinput.KEY_LEFTALT, uinput.KEY_TAB]) as device:
        device.emit_combo([uinput.KEY_LEFTALT, uinput.KEY_TAB])

See examples/ for other kind of example devices (keyboard, joystick).

Note that you must have the uinput kernel module loaded to use
python-uinput. To load the module, run:

    modprobe -i uinput

If you would like to have uinput to be loaded on every sytem boot, add
uinput to /etc/modules.

# How to install


Just run the following commands:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install
